##For this assignment, I will
##1. Read the data set into an appropriate format
##2. Display a histogram of total steps per day, and calculate the mean and median number of steps taken each day.
##3. Make a “time series” plot showing average steps taken during each 5-minute interval, and discuss what this plot shows.
##4. I’m going to discuss the presence of missing values, devise a strategy to keep them from affecting my results, and create a new dataset with the missing value filled in. Then I’ll make a new histogram and discuss the difference between this data set and that I used for the analysis in Step 3.
##5. Look for pattern differences in weekends vs weekdays.


##Loading and preprocessing the data
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip("activity.zip")
}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClass=c('integer', 'Date', 'integer'))
##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
#The total number of steps taken per day

steps.date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
head(steps.date)

#Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

barplot(steps.date$steps, names.arg=steps.date$date, ylim=c(0, 25000), xlab="date", ylab="sum(steps)",)


#Mean of total number of steps taken per day

mean(steps.date$steps)

#Median of total number of steps taken per day

median(steps.date$steps)

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
#Time series plot of the 5-minute interval and average number of steps taken averaged across all days

steps.interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
plot(steps.interval, type='l')


#The 5-minute interval contains the maximum number of steps

steps.interval$interval[which.max(steps.interval$steps)]

##Imputing missing values
#The total number of missing values in the dataset is

sum(is.na(activity$steps))

#The strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset is to use mean of the day.

#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

activity.clean <- merge(activity, steps.date, by="date", suffixes=c("", ".mean"))
nas <- is.na(activity.clean$steps)
activity.clean$steps[nas] <- activity.clean$steps.mean[nas]
activity.clean <- activity.clean[, c(1:3)]
head(activity.clean)

#Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

steps.date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity.clean, sum)
barplot(steps.date$steps, names.arg=steps.date$date, ylim=c(0, 25000),xlab="date", ylab="sum(steps)",)


#Mean of total number of steps taken per day

mean(steps.date$steps)

#Median of total number of steps taken per day

median(steps.date$steps)

#Data don’t appear to be significant different because imputation uses mean for that particular day but steps are NA for that entire day.

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
#Add new factor variable dayType with 2 levels – “weekday” and “weekend”

dayType <- function(dates) {
  f <- function(date) {
    if (weekdays(date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) {
      "weekend"
    }
    else {
      "weekday"
    }
  }
  sapply(dates, f)
}

activity$dayType <- as.factor(dayType(activity$date))
str(activity)

#Panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekdays and weekends

library(lattice)

steps.interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dayType, activity, mean)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | dayType, data=steps.interval, layout=c(2,1), type='l')
